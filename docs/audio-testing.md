# Audio pipeline testing and risks

From `AUDIO_PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.pdf` §§8–9.

## Testing strategy

| Component | Test approach |
|-----------|---------------|
| `render_package` | Contract invariants on every fixture; schema validation |
| `analysis/reconcile` | Planner vs inferred analysis on own MIDI, per-field tolerances |
| `groove/apply` | Hypothesis: offsets within 1 tick; note-count rules; velocity idempotence |
| Metrics | Monotonicity under synthetic corruption; failing metrics leave the objective |
| `tuning_check` | Pure 19-EDO tones ≈ 0¢; 12-TET flattening exceeds threshold |
| `chunking` | Seams on downbeats; equal-power; unmodified reassembly sample-identical |
| Endpoint wrappers | vcrpy record/replay; never hit paid APIs in default CI |
| Orchestrator | Cache hit ⇒ bit-identical; budget abort reports best-so-far |
| Architecture | Import-direction + core-import-weight tests |
| E2E | 8-bar fixture through M1+M2 in CI, fluidsynth/simple, under ~60s |

Human audit: HTML report per run (stems, spectrograms, metrics, prompts).

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Diffusion pulls 19-EDO → 12-TET | B3 routing; f0-following; tuning floor; skip-restyle default |
| Endpoint terms/pricing change | RestyleEndpoint protocol ≥2 impls; local MusicGen for search logic |
| Spend overruns | Budget guard; open-weight for broad search |
| madmom/demucs install pain | Extras groups; light deterministic spine; pin/containerize heavy path |
| Symbolic blockers | Fixture corpus + contract decoupling |
| Invalid LLM groove specs | pydantic validate; reject-and-retry; measured templates override |
| Scorer gaming | Hard floors; monotonicity tests; milestone human audits |
| Rights / watermarks | Provenance manifest; MIDI-GPT flagged off by default |
